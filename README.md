I'm an infrastructure engineer who writes terraform, python and golang. When I'm cornered I can be made to write YAML manifests as well.

### Notable Work

#### [Advent of Code](https://github.com/Alex-Waring/AoC)
Solutions to AoC, mostly written in golang. I have improved a lot over the years and have gone from struggling through the mid stages
to now being competitive in company leaderboards. As well as a cool way to learn, it scratches the itch in my brain that I lost since
I stopped Maths.

#### [Docker](https://github.com/Alex-Waring/docker)
A quickly thrown together project that implements the fundamentals of docker using golang and syscalls. I created this to help me to 
learn how docker works in more depth.

#### [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium)
I am a very infrequent contributer, mostly in the area of it's interaction with AWS, as that's where I am most useful and where I think
it neads the most attention. My only notable (non bug fix) addition is half of the SecurityGroup rules for CNPs.
